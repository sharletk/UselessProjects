# WildAlert: Nature's Smartwatch (Real Time Monitoring & Alert System) üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Sharlet Kurien's Team

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sharlet George Kurien - Saintgits College of Engineering (Autonomous), Kottayam, Kerala

### Project Description
A real-time monitoring and alert system that tracks wildlife species, evaluates their state, and assesses environmental conditions to better monitor and protect wildlife.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if animals felt left out of the smartwatch revolution? Wildlife needs personalized fitness tracking too!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing "FitBit for Fauna" ‚Äî a real-time system that monitors wildlife movements, emotional states, and environmental vibes, sending alerts for when a lion needs yoga or a panda craves cooler bamboo. üåø

### Implementation  

#### For Software:  

**Installation**  
1. Install **Node.js** and **npm**.  
   ```bash  
   sudo apt install nodejs npm   # For Linux  
   brew install node             # For macOS  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies in the monitor directory:  
   ```bash  
   npm install
   ```  

**Run**  
1. Start the server:  
   ```bash  
   node server.js  
   ```  
2. Open the browser and navigate to the provided server URL.  

#### For Hardware:  
1. Assemble components on the breadboard as per the circuit design.  
2. Write and upload the Arduino sketch via **Arduino IDE** to the ESP32:  
   - Ensure Wi-Fi credentials are set in the sketch.  
   - Use the installed libraries for interfacing with sensors and the OLED display.  
3. Verify data transmission from ESP32 to the server via WebSocket.  
4. Use the web application to visualize data and interact with the system.
